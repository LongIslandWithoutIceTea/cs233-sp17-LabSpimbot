# Catching Strategy:
#   We decide to catch 5 bunnies (randomly since we just can't figure out how to
#   get to the nearest one, but never mind) at a time before putting all of them
#   back to the Playpen. Meanwhile, the puzzle-solving procedure will be
#   executed whenever our number of carrots is less than 5 (and hope that the
#   bunny’s weight won't exceed the limit). The robot chooses the bunny at the
#   first index of the bunnies_info as its target (somewhat randomly since we
#   just can't figure out how to get to the nearest one, but never mind, it can
#   run).
# Unlocking competitor’s playpen:
#   Every time after the robot returns to our playpen and drops the bunnies, it
#   will go to the opponent's playpen and unlock it before starting the next
#   round of bunny-chasing.
